The goal of this kata is to create a function (or macro) that accepts any number of vectors in imput, and returns the set of all combinations.

This was inspired by [yesterday's Paris Coding Dojo session](http://xp-france.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?DojoDeveloppement/Lundi22Mars2010), where Brian Marick proposed and performed this kata. I wanted to try it by just wrapping a call to Clojure's list comprehension (or `for` macro).
